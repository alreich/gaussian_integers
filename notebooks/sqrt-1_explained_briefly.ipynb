    "Real numbers are familiar numbers like 0, 7, -3, 2.48, $\\sqrt{2}$, and $\\pi$.\n",
    "\n",
    "For those whose memory is bit foggy on math, $\\sqrt{2}$ is notation for the *square root* of $2$. $\\sqrt{2}$ represents a number which when multiplied by itself equals $2$. That is, $\\sqrt{2} \\times \\sqrt{2} = 2$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The square root of a negative number, like $\\sqrt{-1}$, isn't possible! Right? I mean, a positive number times a positive number is a positive number. And, a negative number times a negative number is also a positive number. So, How could a number, when multiplied by itself, ever be negative? No way.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sometimes having a negative square root show up during a calculation isn't always a Bad Thing. If one bravely continues calculating, the negative square root might sometimes disappear, \"cancelling out\", and the result would then be a nice wholesome **real** number.\n",
